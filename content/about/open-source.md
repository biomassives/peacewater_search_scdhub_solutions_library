- SCD Hub's mission is to serve as a hub for sustainable community development in order to provide trustworthy development & training tools to facilitate project planning, design & execution.

- SCD Hub serves a curated collection information supporting best practices in sustainable community development, at this time we are working closely with the new UNM Peace Engineering program improve the quality of our database and improve how it serves the short, medium and long term planning goals of projects. 


- Our current work emphasizes the life cycle of water.  The list of outcomes is fine for a start.  Clearly defined project goals and objectives are a crucial element for planning the activities and inputs required to launch and sustain a project.
