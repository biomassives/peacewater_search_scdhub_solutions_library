Open Plastics Burn Abatement
<!--more-->

> Open burn piles remain a suprisingly common way that solid waste meets its final fate.

"Open Burn Pits – What Was Burned
<BR>
Waste products commonly disposed of in open burn pits include:
<BR>
<ul>
    <li>Chemicals, paint, medical and human waste
    <li>Metal and aluminum cans
    <li>Munitions and unexploded ordnance
    <li>Petroleum and lubricant products
    <li>Plastics, rubber, wood, and food waste
</ul>
<BR>
Exposure to smoke created by burning these materials may cause irritation and burning of eyes or throat, coughing, breathing difficulties, skin itching or rashes. Many of these conditions are temporary and resolve on their own when the exposure ends. However, if you were closer to burn pit smoke or were exposed for longer periods of time, you may be at greater risk for longer-term health conditions."

Outline the roles and responsibilities of four groups we believe to be key to tackling the plastic pollution crisis:
<p>
    Multinational consumer goods companies who drive the production of single-use plastic packaging, and currently do little to collect and sustainably manage the waste they have created.<BR>
    Developed country governments who have enabled and incentivised a ‘throwaway’ culture and whose response to the crisis in developing countries has so far been weak.<BR>
    Developing country governments whose citizens are the most severely impacted by the crisis
    Citizens who can show that there is an overwhelming demand for change.<BR>
